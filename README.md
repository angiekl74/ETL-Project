# ETL-Project

# Motivation
This is a group ETL project for the UO Data Analytics Bootcamp.  The purpose of this project is to
learn how to submit a Final Report that describes the following:
- Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
- Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
- Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.

# Topic
